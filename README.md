# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Testing is the best way to ensure that code, programs, and/or software are functional and secure. Since the goal of testing is to uncover bugs and other vulnerabilities within a program, it is the best chance at making sure something doesn't go wrong. Ideally, someone other than the developer will test the program. This helps avoid bias since the goals of the developer and tester should be opposites of each other (with the goal of the developer being to create fully functional code and the goal of the tester being to find errors in a program). Nevertheless, unit tests such as the ones displayed in this program can be created based on the system requirements.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are abstracted from the customer requirements documentation which would have been gathered at the beginning of the project. It is important not to drift from these requirements as doing so could result in the end product being different from what the customer expected. This includes refraining from adding functionality that "makes sense" but wasn't specifically asked for.

# How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software from an iterative standpoint. Once the requirements have been gathered, I do some brainstorming and then begin writing code. I know the first code I write will likely not be the final code so I don't spend much time making sure to get it right the first time. I then iterate back over the code I've written and improve upon it. Once I believe the code is complete, I create unit tests and undergo more iterations of the code to make improvements until the unit tests pass, there is appropriate code coverage, and the requirements are met.
